<h1>Welcome to the discovery of influence and decision making in logic and impulse</h1>
<p>The online and digital world tends to desensitize us to what we are either inputting into it
    or what the output is of our action in that space. The normalization of gambling is that in
    a sense. Predatory practices directed towards children through the use of colorful and
    extravagant costumes for their avatars online are largely achieved through a sort of
    randomized function. This story is just that, the normalization of gambling throughout
    our culture and the potential dangers that can come from it. As you progress through
    this story think of how a child thinks of money and their lack of knowledge of its worth.</p>
